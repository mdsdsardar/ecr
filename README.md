**CI/CD Pipeline Overview**

This repository utilizes a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline orchestrated through GitHub Actions. The pipeline is designed to automate the build, testing, and deployment processes, ensuring that code changes are thoroughly vetted before reaching production.

**Key Features of the Pipeline GitHub Managed Runner (ubuntu-latest):**
The pipeline uses GitHub's managed runner, specifically the ubuntu-latest environment, which provides a consistent and up-to-date Linux environment for running CI/CD tasks.

**Repository Checkout and Docker Environment Setup:**
The pipeline begins by checking out the repository using the actions/checkout@v3 action provided by GitHub. This ensures that the latest code is available in the runner's workspace.
Following this, the Docker environment is set up on the runner, enabling the subsequent steps to build and manage Docker images.

**ECR Login:**
Authentication to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is established to facilitate the uploading of Docker images. This step is crucial for securely pushing images to a private container registry.

**Image Tagging and Pushing:**
A unique timestamp is generated to tag each Docker image, making it easy to identify and manage different versions of the images.
The images are then built and pushed to the ECR repository, ensuring that the latest versions are available for deployment.

**AWS CLI Setup:**
The AWS CLI is installed and configured in the runner environment. This is essential as all subsequent AWS operations, including ECS deployments, are managed via the CLI.

**Capture Previous Task Definition:**
Before making any changes, the pipeline captures the current ECS task definition. This allows for easy rollback in case of deployment failures, ensuring minimal disruption to the application.

**Deploy to ECS Test/Sanity Environment:**
The pipeline deploys the new Docker images to an ECS Test or Sanity environment. This intermediate step allows for thorough testing and validation of the changes before they are released to production.

**Integration Testing:**
Integration tests are run against the deployed changes. If the tests fail, the pipeline automatically triggers a rollback operation using the previously captured task definition.
If the tests succeed, the pipeline proceeds to deploy the changes to the production environment.

**Service Stability Check:**
Before deploying to production, the pipeline ensures that the ECS service is in a stable state. This precautionary step helps avoid potential deployment failures and ensures that the service is ready to handle new changes.

**Summary**
This CI/CD pipeline is designed with robustness and reliability in mind, automating the entire process from code checkout to production deployment. By incorporating steps for testing, rollback, and service stability, it ensures that only thoroughly tested and stable code is deployed, minimizing the risk of production issues.
